# Youtube-Design

## In this repository I have tried to recreate my youtube.com Home page. Challenging my skills in HTML CSS. Here I implemented every html technique i knew at the time eg: Grid layout, Flexbox, Inline block, Css Positions, Media Queries and much more. I have tried to make the page completely responsive just like in youtube.com home page
